    There are points, metapoints, and metametapoints at first.<br><br>
    Metapoints cost points and boost points, and they reset points too. Metametapoints cost metapoints, and reset both metapoints and points.<br><br>
    This allows an extremely fast growth, and at 1.8e308, or Infinity, you can Infinity and get one IP (Infinity Point). With IP, you can buy upgrades, and continue farther and farther into the game.<br><br>
    100 IP gets Break Infinity, which you can continue farther than Infinity and get more IP as a result.<br><br>
    At 1.8e308 IP, you can Eternity and get 1 EP (Eternity Point), which boosts point, metapoint, and metametapoint gain.<br><br>
    When you get 1 EP, you can get Lucky Points, which boosts Eternity point gain. They spawn randomly.

    And basically everything was stolen from Antimatter Dimensions so go play it here<br><br>
