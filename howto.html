    General tips:
    <ul>
      <li>Use the keyboard shortcuts. It's easier to play</li>
      <li>When over 17 metametapoints, press 7 10 times, and then spam, or press quickly 87 a lot of times. Then press 9, and repeat.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Early-game</h1>
    To begin the game press the "Get point" button. You will get one Point. Get 10 points, and then click the "Reset for metapoints" button. You will get one Metapoint, but lose all points. Metapoints boost Point gain by round(metapoints/2). This allows an exponential growth since you actually get round(Points/10) metapoints. 10 metapoints allows you to get a metametapoint by resetting your metapoints and points. Metametapoints boost and cost metapoints the same way metapoints boost and cost points. This allows an extremely fast growth, so you can get to Infinity, or 2^1024, around 1.79*10^308, or 1.8e308.
    <h1>Early-mid-game</h1>
    When you get to Infinity metametapoints, you can get an Infinity point by clicking the "Infinity for 1 Infinity Point" button. This button resets all metametapoints, metapoints, and points. With Infinity Points (IP), you can buy Infinity Upgrades on the Upgrades tab, or clicking the "Upgrades" button on the top of the screen. One important upgrade is Break Infinity. This upgrade allows you to get higher than Infinity metametapoints, and get more IP as a reward. These upgrades will help you eventually get Infinity IP, so you can Eternity. Eternity resets Infinity upgrades, IP, metametapoints, metapoints, and points, but you get one Eternity Point (EP).
    <h1>Late-mid-game</h1>
    One EP boosts point, metapoint, and metametapoint gain by 10, two EP by 100, and so on. Also, when you get one EP you have a chance of getting a Lucky Point (LP). An LP spawns around once every 10 minutes with one EP, 5 minutes with 10, 3.33 minutes with 100, 2.5 with 1000, and so on. With one LP you get 10 EP instead of one, two LP gives you 100, and so on. When you get Infinity EP, you can Minecraftify, and gain one fist and 5 crafts in the Minecraftify tab.
    <h1>Late-game</h1>
    Minecraftify, like other prestige systems, resets everything before. With a fist, you can mine with the fist, and 50% chance of getting a Wood and 5% of an Apple. With Wood, you can make Sticks, and make a Wood Pickaxe, and mine with the Wood Pickaxe. Then you get Stone by mining with a Wood pickaxe, and able to make a Stone pickaxe, and so on. The game ends when you use an Enderite pickaxe to mine a Meta-portal with a 1% chance. I was going to make more material after that, but I didn't know what to make.
