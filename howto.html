    There are points, metapoints, and metametapoints at first.<br><br>
    Metapoints cost points and boost points, and they reset points too. Metametapoints cost metapoints, and reset both metapoints and points.<br><br>
    This allows an extremely fast growth, and at 1.8e308, or Infinity, you can Infinity and get one IP (Infinity Point). With IP, you can buy upgrades, and continue farther and farther into the game.<br><br>
    That's the end
